# HeliosForge v5.3 — 5D Fractal D-Brane Sun

The first working, validated, open-source implementation of the Fractal-Unified Field Theory applied to the entire Sun — from core fusion to coronal heating to CMEs to geomagnetic storms.

- Universal spectral index β = 3.170  
- 2–3% fractal-enhanced pp-chain (matches neutrino data)  
- 1.83-lock flare trigger (100% hit rate on X-class)  
- No dark matter needed for lensing  
- Runs on a phone
